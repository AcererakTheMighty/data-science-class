#It seems that yes, a lot of people watched The Matrix and decided to name their kid Trinity. Honestly, I can't even deny, Trinity isn't that bad of a name, it's just that when you name your kid after a character there's a chance it could end poorly. I mean, there are kids named after characters from Game of Thrones, and as we know, Game Of Thrones isn't even talked about anymore.
